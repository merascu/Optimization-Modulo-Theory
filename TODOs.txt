0) Can not transform the objective function into assert-soft like in [1],
since the value of the weight is not known as below

; Optimization goals are expressed implicitly via assert-soft command.
(assert-soft (not y1) :id num_servers)
(assert-soft (not y2) :id num_servers)
(assert-soft (not y3) :id num_servers)

(assert-soft (not y1) :id costs :weight 10)
(assert-soft (not y2) :id costs :weight 5)
(assert-soft (not y3) :id costs :weight 20)
