***Constrained Optimization Benchmark for Optimization Modulo Theory: a Cloud Resource Management Problem***

The development, assessment, and comparison of Optimization Modulo Theory (OMT) algorithms and tools heavily depends on benchmarking. To the best of our knowledge, there is no benchmark environment for OMT, much less one which bears any relation to the number of distinct problem features. We propose a scalable linear, respectively non-linear, constrained optimization problem that is suitable for benchmarking OMT solvers.

This repository provides a Python implementation of the benchmarking environment introduced in the paper: "Constrained Optimization Benchmark for Optimization Modulo Theory: a Cloud Resource Management Problem" by M. Erascu and R. Metes, submitted to SMT2019 workshop.

The reporting of implementation issues as well as suggestions for improvement (or modification) are welcome. Please contact madalina.erascu___at___e-uvt.ro
